        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the lemon juice, mayo, and spice mixture. Add the chicken thighs and thoroughly coat the exterior. Cover and place in the fridge for up to 24hrs or cook right away.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, place a pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, sear the chicken thighs on both sides until internal temp reaches 165 F. Chop the chicken into pieces in the pan or let rest then slice.</li>
