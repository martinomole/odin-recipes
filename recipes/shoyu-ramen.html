    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ramen is a popular Japanese dish that consists of noodles, usually made of wheat flour, served in a broth alongside various toppings and flavorings. There are multiple types of ramen depending on the type of soup or toppings used.</p>
    <p>The shoyu ramen, which will be covered in this recipe, consists of a chicken and fish stock with plenty of soy sauce to give it some deep flavoring.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>For the tare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The day before, soak the squares of kombu in your soy sauce overnight. This is the base, and we extract a lot of flavor here.</li>
        <li>The day of, take your niboshi and saute them in a bit of neutral oil on high heat until fragrant in a sauce pan, about 40 seconds to a minute. We’re doing maillard stuff here, so a little brown is good.</li>
        <li>Add your kombu and soy sauce, and bring to 176 F. At 176, discard the kombu.</li>
        <li>Hold the mixture at 176 for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the bonito and continue to steep for 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain out the solids and reserve the soy base into a separate vessel.</li>
        <li>Clean the pan, add the sake, mirin, and sugar, and cook on medium high heat until the smell of alcohol is gone, around 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the strained soy base, and cook over low heat until reduced to your salinity liking. You can use it right away, but I like to reduce it somewhat to keep things compact.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the noodles</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add baked soda and salt (and riboflavin if using) to the water, dissolve completely. I like to add one at a time, it seems like the baked soda dissolves better if added prior to the salt.</li>
        <li>In the food processor, add your wheat gluten and flour. Pulse a few times to combine the two.</li>
        <li>While running the food processor, add your water mixture slowly, in an even stream. Occasionally, stop to scrape the sides down. You know you're set when you have tiny grain like pieces.</li>
        <li>Cover the food processor and let this rest for 30 minutes. This gives the flour granules time to fully absorb the water and alkaline salts.</li>
        <li>Knead it. Currently I use an electric pasta machine to sheet the dough, going through the largest setting, then the 2nd, then the 3rd, then folding and repassing through the largest setting. I repass two to three times, or until I notice the dough is making the machine work really hard. I also like to fold the dough the same direction each time. Some articles I read suggested this kept the gluten strands running in the same direction, which promotes better texture. You'll notice interesting horizontal lines running along the length of your dough if you do it right. If this isn’t an option for you, I used to throw the mix into a plastic bag and step on it repeatedly, which simulates the kneading process used in an industrial setting.</li>
        <li>When smooth, cover with plastic, and rest at room temp for an hour. This gives the gluten time to relax, and “ripens” the dough according to Japanese cooks.</li>
        <li>Pull out your dough. Portion into workable sizes (around one serving's worth), and roll out to desired thickness, using potato starch as you go to prevent sticking. Do this with a pasta machine, it is borderline impossible without a machine. An electric one will save you an incredible amount of effort.</li>
        <li>Cut your noodles to your desired thickness. You rule your ramen.</li>
        <li>Ideally you should make these noodles in advance, they’re really nice after about a day in the fridge. They firm up a bit, and most recipes for noodles online discuss this resting phase prior to use. The general rule for this cure is that the higher the hydration, the longer the wait.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the soup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Blanch the chicken feet for 5 minutes in water. Strain, and snip off toenails.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken to a stock pot, cover with water.</li>
        <li>Bring the stock up to 176 on high heat. Hold here for one hour</li>
        <li>Bring the stock up to a boil briefly, skim any scum. Hold here for 5-10 minutes, or until scum subsides.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat back down to 176, hold for a minimum of 5 hours.</li>
        <li>After hitting 176, add your onion, garlic, and ginger. It’s going to perfume the fat that renders out of the chicken. It’s awesome.</li>
        <li>In the last hour add niboshi and kombu. Remove kombu in 10 min, keep niboshi for 30 min to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>    In the last 10 minutes, add the bonito flake and steep. 9 Strain the stock and hold until needed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once all of the ingredients are ready assemble by placing 2 or 3 spoons of the tare into a bowl, followed by the broth, the noodles, and the toppings.</p>
